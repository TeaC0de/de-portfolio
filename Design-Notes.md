# 🌿 de-portfolio | Design Notes & Thought Process

This document collects the small but meaningful design decisions I made while creating **de-portfolio**. From layout to color to typography, each choice was guided by a desire to create something clear, structured, and visually thoughtful.

It’s not just about code — it’s about learning how to craft a visual identity that communicates who I am, even as I’m still growing as a front-end developer.

These notes reflect how I approached the design process from a beginner’s perspective: what influenced me, what I tried, and what I learned along the way.

## ✏️ Getting Started

Before writing any code, I took some time to define what this portfolio was meant to do — and how I wanted it to feel.

I asked myself:
- What should someone see and understand within the first few seconds?
- How can I make the experience feel simple and welcoming?
- What kind of projects and information are most relevant right now?

I made a few rough layout sketches on paper, browsed other portfolios, and saved visual references that felt aligned with the direction I was going for.

## 🎨 Color Palette

My color choices were inspired by a bouquet photo that felt calm, soft, and slightly vintage. I didn’t use a generator — just started from that image and adjusted tones until everything worked together on the screen.

From there, I adjusted each color until the overall look felt balanced and gentle on the eyes.

**Palette:**

- `#ded3d7` — soft blush/petal tone  
- `#5d534d` — deep mauve/plum shadow  
- `#b8a09b` — muted rose  
- `#e7d9d2` — pale cream  
- `#a4b19f` — gentle sage green  
- `#83797a` — dusty neutral/mauve

This palette gives the site a subtle personality without overwhelming the content.

## ✒️ Typography

I explored different font pairings before landing on something that felt right for the tone I wanted.

- **Headings:** Dancing Script — adds character and lightness
- **Body text:** Lora — a classic serif that’s readable and structured

I didn’t dive deep into typography settings yet, but I made sure the pairing felt visually balanced and worked well with the overall layout. There’s still a lot I want to learn about spacing, sizing, and accessibility — but this was a good starting point.

## 🧭 Layout Planning

I chose a single-scroll layout to create a natural flow through the portfolio — more like a guided overview than a set of disconnected pages.

However, I decided to open **Projects** and **CV & Certifications** in new tabs. They needed more space for details, and I didn’t want to clutter the main scroll.

The main sections:
- Home
- About
- Projects (opens separately)
- CV & Certifications (opens separately)
- Contact

I kept the navigation simple. No JavaScript yet — just smooth scroll.

## 🌱 Things I’m Still Exploring

- How to design for interactivity — buttons, hover states, smooth transitions  
- Making components feel dynamic without overcomplicating the layout  
- UI/UX basics — how to make things intuitive and easy to use  
- Balancing aesthetics with accessibility and readability  
- How to plan and test responsive layouts for mobile

These are all things I’m learning gradually — by building and iterating in real projects.

## 📝 Notes to Myself

- It's okay to start with simple decisions and refine later.
- Not every design idea needs to be unique — clarity is more important.
- This is version 1. I can rebuild later when I’ve grown more.

## 🌸 Final Reflection

Designing this portfolio has been as much about learning how to make decisions as it has been about colors and layout. There were moments where I wasn’t sure what looked right or what direction to go — but making choices, testing things, and letting go of “perfect” helped me move forward.

This version is simple, and that’s intentional. It reflects where I am now, and leaves room for growth later. I’m starting small, but with structure, and I know I can build on this over time.
