# 🌸 Dorothea | Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio — a space where I bring together everything I’m learning, building, and creating as I grow into front-end development. This project reflects my interest in design, thoughtful code, and user-friendly experiences.

---

## 📍 Current Progress
Structure and layout are currently in progress.  
Styling and interactivity will follow in the next development phase.

---

## 🌷 A Glimpse Into This Project
This portfolio is designed as a long-scroll experience, gently guiding visitors through my background, current work, and creative journey.  
The **Projects** and **CV & Certifications** sections open in separate tabs to offer a more detailed look — including project visuals, code highlights, and downloadable materials — while keeping the main scroll experience seamless.

## 🌿 The Why Behind It All
This portfolio is more than a collection of work — it’s a reflection of who I am as a creative learner and aspiring frontend developer.  
I want it to feel intuitive, thoughtful, and beautifully made — just like the experiences I hope to build in the future.
